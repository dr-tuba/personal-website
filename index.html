    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p id="intro">I am currently a software engineering student at the Flatiron School with a background in classical music and education. I have worked in public schools and in higher education while maintaining an active performing life as well. I am Adjunct Professor of Euphonium at the University of Northern Colorado where I get to teach private lessons to music students. I also play Principal Tuba with the Fort Collins Symphony where I get to perform with a professional symphony orchestra for the Fort Collins community. I am excited to see how I can combine my love for music and software in the future!</p>
